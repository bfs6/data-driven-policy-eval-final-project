## Processing
L2 assigns each voter to a 2010 Census Block on their Voter File. 
L2 provided the RDH with a file that has each individual and their corresponding 2020 Census Block, dated 9/28/2021. 
The RDH joined the L2 Voter File to this 2020 Census Block assignment file. 
The RDH then aggregated the individual level Voter File to the Census Block level. The RDH then used the 2020 Census Block to VTD Assignment files to aggregate the 2020 Census Block level to the 2020 VTD level. 
The fields were renamed to fit character length requirements (under 10 chars) for joining to a shapefile. 
Processing was completed using SQL and Python. 
The RDH cannot certify the accuracy of any of the information contained within this file. 

## Additional Notes
* The party fields are modeled by L2 for MO. The following information is provided by L2 on party modeling: 
L2 has partnered with academic analysts to create party models for states lacking such registration information. The modeling is based on a great many public and private data sources including demographics available through the voter file, exit polling from presidential elections, commercial lifestyle indicators, census data, self-reported party preferences from private polling and more.  Combining all of these data sets through Bayesian analysis and other statistical techniques has resulted in the “likely” party affiliations we have applied to the voter files in these states. L2 cannot guarantee that any single voter will self-identify as being associated with the assigned “likely” party.  We believe that the accuracy level is 85% or better but make no guarantees.  Users of the data should remember that this is a probability-only indicator of preferences.  L2 is offering these probability indicators at no additional charge and we hope that you’ll find them useful in your targeting.  We invite customers’ comments about their experiences with the accuracy of the models so that the feedback can be used in future refinements. 

** For the narrow ethnicity categories, RDH is providing an aggregate of all ethnicities that have more than 1000 individuals state-wide. L2 ethnicity categories use modeling techniques to infer an individual's ethnicity. Please see the attached PDF for  more information about L2's ethnicity fields. European includes the following narrow-categories, that are not broken out on this file: 
Austrian, Basque, Belgian, Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Dutch (Netherlands), English/Welsh, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Icelandic, Irish, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Luxembourgian, Maltese, Moldavian, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Scots, Slovakian, Slovenian, Swedish, Swiss
